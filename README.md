# PolygonAproximationPi
Aproximation of Pi using a regular polygon with a very large number of sides.


Definition of Pi is the cuocient between the perimeter and diameter of a circle. You can get an aproximate value of Pi just mesuring this parameters, but you will have an error, because mesaures have errors.

Also, a perfect circle is a concept. Not a real circle can be constructed. In a circle, every point is equaly near of a central point. This is also true for vertices of regular
polygons. The diffrerence between circles and polygons is the last ones have infinite points, while polygons have a finite amount of vertices. 

If we consider a regular polygon whith N sides, when N is a very large number, the perimeter of this polygon will be aproximately the circle perimeter

In this project, I present an algorithm to mesaure de permiter of a regular polygon. it recives the number of sides and estimates the pi value with this parameter.
The solution given uses pure geometry.

The script was written on Python 3.7.
