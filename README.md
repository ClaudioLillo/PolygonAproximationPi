# PolygonAproximationPi
Aproximation of Pi by using a regular polygon with a very large number of sides.


Definition of Pi is the cuocient between perimeter and diameter of a circle. We can get an aproximate value of Pi measuring this parameters, but it implicates experimental errors.

Perfect  circle is a figure in wich every point is equaly near of a central point. 

On the other hand, vertices of regular polygons are also equaly near of the polygon center.

If a regular polygon with N sides and mayor diagonal = D is used. When N is a very large number, perimeter of this figure will be aproximately equal to perimeter of a circle with diameter = D.
(Note that major diagonal passes through the center of polygon, only when N is an even number. For this reason, is used a polygon inscribed in circle)

I present an algorithm to estimates the pi value using a regular polygon simulation of 2^n sides and diameter = 1. The script was written on Python 3.7.
